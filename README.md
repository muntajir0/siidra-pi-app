# Siidra Digital Mall (MVP)

This repository is the Siidra Digital Mall web app scaffold (React + TypeScript + Vite).

Purpose
- MVP storefront to showcase products in the Pi Ecosystem.
- Client-side integration point for Pi Network SDK (login / wallet connect).
- Easy to extend with a backend (Node/Firebase) later.

Quick start (local)
1. Install:
   - `npm install` or `yarn`
2. Run dev server:
   - `npm run dev`
3. Build:
   - `npm run build`

Pi SDK integration
- A placeholder component `src/components/PiLogin.tsx` is included.
- Replace the TODO / placeholder code with the official Pi SDK loader / initialization from minepi.com and add any required developer keys.

Next steps after you confirm:
- I will push this scaffold into the repository (branch `feature/initial-scaffold`) and open a PR.
- After that we can add: product management, admin panel, backend, and real Pi token transfer flow.

Questions:
- Web or Mobile?
- Provide Pi SDK docs / keys if available
- Permission to push to repo?
